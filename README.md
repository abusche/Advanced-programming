# Crous menu application

The aim of this project is to develop an application that can be used to find out about menus at the Crous of the University of Strasbourg.
Our aim is to create an interactive application that lets you chat with an AI via an instant messaging system via Dash, Streamlit or/and WhatsApp.

To do this, we are going to use webscrapping to obtain information about the menus at the Crous de Strasbourg and store it in an SQL database.
We will then connect to an LLM to interact with this database.

We also want to add elements such as geographical proximity, the relevance of timetables (Lunch or Dinner), an allergy alert and an alternative for foreign languages.
What's more, if time allows, we want to extend this to all the universities in France.
